    <p><span data-actor="EDDIE">EDDIE: Luke and I are inseparable.(Looks towards Luke and Roxanne:) Well, we used to be. </span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="ROXANNE">ROXANNE: (To Luke:) Whoa!  Careful with the sprinkles! </span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="LUKE">LUKE: Oh, sorry. </span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="EDDIE">EDDIE: Did you hear that?  Careful with the sprinkles?  She's so controlling! </span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="LUKE">LUKE: How's it look so far?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="ROXANNE">ROXANNE: More frosting on this side.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="EDDIE">EDDIE: And demanding!  Luke never used to worry about where he sprinkled...awkward.  I hate myself.  And he definitely wouldn't let some girl tell him how to make a cake.  Who makes cakes together?  You know, if a miracle ever happens and I ever end up in Wendy's pan—with Wendy, then she would want to hang out with my other friends!  And by other friends, I mean Luke.  She's that kind of wonderful girl.  All Roxanne ever wants to do is hang out with Luke and nobody else.  She probably doesn't care about me at all. </span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="ROXANNE">ROXANNE: So how's Eddie doing? </span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="EDDIE">EDDIE: All right—that's not fair. </span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="LUKE">LUKE: I don't know.  Haven't seen much of him lately.  He always seems too preoccupied with Wendy. </span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="EDDIE">EDDIE: Is he serious?  Me preoccupied with Wendy?  When was the last time he invited me to the movies with him and Roxanne?  Yeah, also awkward.  I'm the third wheel.  I'm going to live the rest of my life as the third wheel.  I'll never find my own wheel.  I'll never be a bicycle.  I'll always be the big, honking wheel on some little girl's tricycle.  That's me.  Eddie the third wheel. </span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="ROXANNE">ROXANNE: He likes Wendy? </span></p>
